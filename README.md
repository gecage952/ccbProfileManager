Updating readme for github. THis software is to be used to add profiles to the West Park Connections social media site (https://westpark.ccbchurch.com/goto/login?rurl=%2Findex.php).
THe api key for the website has been removed for the github version, so unauthorized profiles are not added.

Builds with ant. (Ex. "ant compile run" in the command line)
An executable jar file is available in the jar folder. ("ant run" automatically executes it)
